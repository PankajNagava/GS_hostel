<h> GSHostel - The institute's Hostel management system </h> <br>
 <br>
 
<b>Primary Tech Stack Used:</b>
<dl>
<li> HTML5 </li>
<li> CSS </li>
<li> FLask </li>
</dl>
In flask we have used many modules like <b> SQLALchemy, werkzeug.security , Flask Login </b> and many more !!
<br> <br>

In this you can create warden account by signing up and then by loging in it , you can add the login credential of hostellite using add hostellite option in it.
We have tried to keep it that way so that while creating hostellite account warden can allot him room number as well and there will be no need for hostellite to make an account
